Here's a simple C++ data container. It's a dynamically allocated list of any data type elements, that works like a queue. It has a basic functionality of:
1. Pushing - adding an element at the end of the list
2. Popping - returning the value and removing the first element from the list
3. Returning the values of first or last element of the list without removing it from the list

The functionality is demonstrated in the main.cpp file.
