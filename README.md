Here's a simple C++ data container. It's a dynamically allocated list of elements, that works like a queue. It has a basic functionality of:
1. Pushing - adding an element at the end of the list
2. Popping - returning the value and removing the first element from the list
3. Returning the values of the first or last element of the list without removing it from the list
4. Returning the length of the list

It works with any data type as long as the data types within the list are not mixed. The functionality is demonstrated in the main.cpp file.
